Helps find the desired social media URLs related to a given input text
It does so by automatically searching google with the text in a file called input.txt that must be in the same directory as the executable
Each line in that input file will result in a new output line
The input file is mainly intended for company names
Each output line will contain:
  Instagram URL
  Number of Instagram follower
  Facebook URL
  Twitter URL
  Number of Twitter followers
  Youtube URL
  "Contact Us" URL
  Main URL
the output files is called output.csv and can be opened as a spreadsheet
If it fails running at a given moment, delete the lines related to inputs it has correctly found already and run it again. It does happen with some frequency
